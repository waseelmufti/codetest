# Code Test

Thank you,  for the code test. I go through your code and here are the my thoughts about your code.

## What makes your code amazing:
* Your code readiblity is awesome. Consistent indentation, proper spacing, short methods make your code easy to read. I didn't put too much time to understand the logic of your code. It is quite sweet and simple.
* Some methods have a description about methods which are explaining the logic, making it easier to understand.
* Use of helper methods show a good separation of concerns by keeping utility functions isolated.
* Variable and function names (e.g., fetchLanguageFromJobId, convertJobIdsInObjs) are descriptive, improving code readability.
* The use of laravel eloquent relationships for database querying, which simplifies query building and helps in maintainability.
* The use of the paginate() function to handle large datasets efficiently, helps to improve performance

## What your code need imporvements
* In some places your code getting static values directly from the .env file. I think it should be taken from any config file.
* Strings like Y-m-d H:i:s for date formats are hardcoded in multiple places. We can use constants or config values for frequently used strings and patterns to centralize and standardize their usage. 
* Data coming from requests ($requestdata) is being used without thorough validation, increasing the risk of faulty or malicious data affecting logic. We can use Laravelâ€™s built-in validation or create validation methods to sanitize and validate inputs before using them in logic.
* Inconsistent variable names, like some variables are in kabeb case ($consumer_type) and some are in camel case (consumerType). for the sake of consistancy we should use only one style.
* In some places user_type is comparing with a value from env file, I think this value should be from a config file.
* I noticed there are many commented code lines, if it is not required than should be removed. This will increase code readiblity and declutter the code.
